The Department of Disaster Management has a plan to develop a web
application that use to report incidents occurred at different locations in Western
Province. Examples of possible incidents are Natural Disasters, Road Side
Accidents, Fires, and Electrical Breakdown & Leakages etc.

Authorized personals from the Police stations, Grama Niladari, Post Office and
assigned members from general public are issued login accounts, to report
incidents.

Incident reports manger has the total authority to approve the incident to be
display in the public web. Incident report manager has a login account that has
an authority to see all new incidents, approved incidents for the public display.

Incident report manager has authority to change the threat level and effect of the
incident to the general public.

Once the incident report manager approves the incidents reported, they will be
shown in a Map of Western Province.
